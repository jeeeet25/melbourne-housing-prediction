## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Melbourne Housing Price Prediction project. The project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to predict housing prices in Melbourne City, Australia, based on historical real estate transaction data.

## Project Title
Melbourne Housing Price Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Project Description
In this project, we analyze a comprehensive dataset of real estate transactions in Melbourne City, Australia, to create accurate models for predicting housing prices. The project involves data collection, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, and the implementation of machine learning models. The goal is to provide valuable insights to homebuyers and real estate professionals, enhancing price transparency and decision-making in the housing market.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model implementation, and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code for the machine learning models.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing an overview of the project.

## Key Features
- Data preprocessing techniques, including handling missing values and feature selection.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) visualizations to gain insights into the Melbourne housing market.
- Implementation of machine learning models, including Random Forest Regressor and Random Forest Classifier for Price Prediction Class.
- Model evaluation using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE).
